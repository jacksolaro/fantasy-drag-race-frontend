<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://github.com/jacksolaro/fantasy-drag-race-frontend/blob/main/src/assets/images/Derby.gif?raw=true)

After losing just about every season of Fantasy Football that I have ever played, I decided there has to be an application that allows me to compete in something that I have extensive knowledge of ... reality tv shows. This was the catalyst that created Derby Leagues, an online platform where you can go head-to-head against friends in a fantasy sports style competition but for hit TV shows.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The site is currently hosted at [https://derby-584f8.web.app/](https://derby-584f8.web.app/)

To get started, follow these easy steps:

1. Create an Account
2. Join or Create a League for an upcoming show
3. Select your Season and Episode Roster
4. Invite friends by sending them your league code

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

This project is still very fresh. I am currently piloting it with a small group of people to flush out some bugs and nail downt the experience.

Some items on my roadmap are:

- creating a profile page for users to view and update their account settings
- creating visual confirmations on Roster Submits
- improving the style of the Scoreboard
